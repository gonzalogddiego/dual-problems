\section{Introduction}

On space and time scales greater than 100m and 1 day, glaciers flow like a viscous, incompressible fluid with a power-law rheology \citep{greve2009dynamics}.
Ice flow is slow enough that the inertial terms in the Navier-Stokes equations can be neglected, i.e. the flow occurs at very low Reynolds number.
There are multiple equivalent ways of expressing the momentum balance equations: a conservation law, a variational form, a partial differential equation.
Each of these forms is best suited to a different type of numerical method.
The momentum balance equation for low-Reynolds number viscous fluid flow can also be derived as the optimality conditions for the velocity to be the critical point of a certain \emph{action functional} \citep{dukowicz2010consistent}.
The action functional has units of energy per unit time and can be interpreted as the rate of dissipation of thermodynamic free energy \citep{edelen1972nonlinear}.
Moreover, for many problems, including low-Reynolds number flow and heat conduction, the action is a convex functional of the unknown field.

The existence of an action principle is a special property of a very restricted class of differential equations.
Action principles are not just of theoretical interest -- we can use them to design faster, more robust numerical solvers.
First, a convex action principle implies that the second derivative is symmetric and positive-definite.
These properties guarantee convergence for Newton-type algorithms.
They also mean that we can use specialized methods, such as Cholesky factorization or the conjugate gradient method, for solving the resulting linear systems of equations \citep{nocedal2006numerical}.
These methods are not applicable to more general classes of linear systems.
Second, the action principle offers a way to measure how well an approximate solution matches the true solution and it is distinct from, say, the square norm of the residual.
The theory of convex optimization then provides us with a way to measure how close we are to convergence without having to know what the true solution is.
In \citet{shapero2021icepack}, we showed how to use this theory to design physics-based convergence criteria.

This work follows in the footsteps of \citet{dukowicz2010consistent} in studying action principles for glacier flow.
Our main contribution is the derivation of an alternative \emph{dual} action principle, distinct from that presented in \citet{dukowicz2010consistent}, from which the momentum conservation equations can be derived.
This dual form explicitly includes the stress as an unknown.
The most important feature, however, is that \textbf{the dual action principle has favorable numerical properties for shear-thinning flows} such as glacier dynamics.
To motivate the derivation, we will first look at the primal and dual forms of a linear problem arising in groundwater flow.
Then we will derive the dual form of the shallow stream equations of glacier dynamics.
Finally, we will illustrate with a numerical implementation.

In the following, we will assume familiarity with (1) the partial differential equations describing glacier flow, (2) variational calculus and the derivation of the Euler-Lagrange equations of a generic functional, and (3) convex analysis and convex duality theory.
For background reading, we refer the reader to \citet{greve2009dynamics} for glacier dynamics, \citet{weinstock1974calculus} for variational calculus, and \citet{boyd2004convex} for convex optimization.


\section{Dual action principles}

\subsection{Groundwater flow}

To illustrate our approach, we will begin by deriving a dual action principle for a simpler problem: groundwater flow in a confined aquifer.
The unknowns in groundwater flow are the fluid velocity $u$ and the pressure head $\phi$.
First, the total mass of water is conserved:
\begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot u = f.
    \label{eq:groundwater-conservation-law}
\end{equation}
where $f$ consists of all sources and sinks.
Next, we need a constitutive law relating the velocity and hydraulic head.
In this case, the rule is Darcy's law
\begin{equation}
    u = -k\nabla\phi
    \label{eq:darcy-law}
\end{equation}
where $k$ is the hydraulic conductivity.
(Note that the conductivity could be a scalar or a rank-2 tensor.)
Substituting Darcy's law into the conservation law eliminates $u$ from the problem, leaving us with a second-order PDE for the pressure head $\phi$.
We must also add the essential Dirichlet boundary condition
\begin{equation}
    \phi|_{\partial\Omega} = g.
    \label{eq:dirichlet-bc}
\end{equation}
We can then show after the fact that this PDE is the Euler-Lagrange equation to minimize the functional
\begin{equation}
    J(\phi) = \int_\Omega\left(\frac{1}{2}k\nabla\phi\cdot\nabla\phi - f\phi\right)\ud x.
\end{equation}
Minimizing $J$ is the \emph{primal} form of the problem.

In the description above, we eliminated the velocity $u$, but we might need this quantity for other reasons, like simulating contaminant dispersal.
We could always calculate the pressure head by solving the Poisson equation and then calculate the velocity afterwards.
What if we instead wanted to solve simultaneously for both $u$ and $\phi$?
Is there some functional $L$ of both fields such that setting the derivative of $L$ to zero yields the pair of equations \eqref{eq:groundwater-conservation-law} and \eqref{eq:darcy-law}?
This idea forms the basis of \emph{dual} or \emph{mixed} formulations of the problem.
The desired functional $L$ is
\begin{equation}
    L(u, \phi) = \int_\Omega\left(\frac{1}{2}k^{-1}u\cdot u - \phi\left(\nabla\cdot u - f\right)\right)\ud x - \int_{\partial\Omega}g\, u\cdot \nu\ud\gamma.
\end{equation}
An elementary computation shows that the Euler-Lagrange equations for a critical point of $L$ are identical to the weak form of equations \eqref{eq:groundwater-conservation-law}, \eqref{eq:darcy-law}, and the boundary condition \eqref{eq:dirichlet-bc}.
In the dual problem, the hydraulic head $\phi$ plays the role of a Lagrange multiplier to enforce the conservation law $\nabla\cdot u = f$.
Note how the essential boundary condition $\phi|_{\partial\Omega} = g$ in the primal problem became a natural boundary condition in the dual problem, i.e. we could include it directly in the Lagrangian.

For our purposes, the most important thing to observe about the dual action is that \textbf{the constitutive relation is inverted}.
Where the form of the Darcy law that we started with was $u = -k\nabla\phi$, taking the derivative of $L$ with respect to $u$ and setting it equal to zero gives
\begin{equation}
    \nabla\phi = -k^{-1}u.
\end{equation}
The two forms are mathematically equivalent, so at this juncture the distinction might not seem very significant.
Indeed, for linear problems one form is as good as the other.
For nonlinear constitutive relations, however, the consequences are more drastic.

\subsection{Shallow stream approximation}

Now we turn to ice dynamics.
In the following, we will consider the \emph{shallow stream approximation}, which assumes that (1) the glacier flow has a small ratio of thickness to horizontal length scale and (2) the flow is a plug flow, i.e. the horizontal velocity is roughly constant with depth.
The key unknowns are the ice velocity $u$ and the \emph{membrane stress tensor} $M$, a rank-2 tensor with units of stress or energy density that results from applying the above approximations to the full deviatoric stress tensor.
The conservation law for membrane stress is
\begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot hM + \tau - \rho gh\nabla s = 0
    \label{eq:membrane-stress-conservation}
\end{equation}
where $h$ and $s$ are the ice thickness and surface elevation and $\tau$ is the basal shear stress.
To close the system of equations, we must provide a constitutive relation between the membrane stress tensor and the depth-averaged strain rate tensor
\begin{equation}
    \dot\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla u + \nabla u^\top\right).
    \label{eq:strain-rate}
\end{equation}
The Glen flow law states that this is a power-law relationship, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    M = A^{-\frac{1}{n}}\sqrt{\frac{\dot\varepsilon\cdot\dot\varepsilon + \text{tr}(\dot\varepsilon)^2}{2}}^{\frac{1}{n} - 1}\left(\dot\varepsilon + \text{tr}(\dot\varepsilon)I\right)
    \label{eq:constitutive-relation}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is the fluidity coefficient and $n \approx 3$ is the Glen flow law exponent.
Finally, we need to provide some kind of sliding relation.
We will assume a generalized power law with some exponent $m$, i.e.
\begin{equation}
    \tau = -C|u|^{\frac{1}{m} - 1}u.
    \label{eq:sliding-law}
\end{equation}
Weertman sliding has $m = n$, while perfectly plasting sliding has $m = \infty$.
Recent research suggests alternative forms that transition between Weertman-type sliding at low speeds and perfectly plasting sliding at higher speeds \citep{minchew2020toward}.
For illustrative purposes equation \eqref{eq:sliding-law} is sufficient, and we will describe how to incorporate alternatives in the discussion.
We can then combine equations \eqref{eq:membrane-stress-conservation}, \eqref{eq:strain-rate}, \eqref{eq:constitutive-relation}, and \eqref{eq:sliding-law} to arrive at a second-order, nonlinear system of partial differential equations for $u$.

The shallow stream equations can be derived as the optimality conditions to find the minimum of the following action functional:
\begin{align}
    J(u) & = \int_\Omega\left(\frac{2n}{n + 1}hA^{-\frac{1}{n}}\sqrt{\frac{\dot\varepsilon\cdot\dot\varepsilon + \text{tr}(\dot\varepsilon)^2}{2}}^{\frac{1}{n} + 1} + \frac{m}{m + 1}C|u|^{\frac{1}{m} + 1} + \rho gh\nabla s\cdot u\right)\ud x  \nonumber \\
    & \qquad + \frac{1}{2}\int_\Gamma\left(\rho_Igh^2 - \rho_Wgh_W^2\right)u\cdot\nu\ud\gamma
    \label{eq:ssa-primal-action}
\end{align}
The action has units of power and, while it is no longer quadratic like the groundwater flow problem, it is still convex.

In the previous section, we derived a dual action principle for groundwater flow as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We started with a conservation law for fluid volume and a constitutive relation between fluid velocity and hydraulic head.
    \item We derived a second-order differential equation for the hydraulic head alone.
    \item We showed how this second-order equation has an action principle.
    \item We showed how there is an equivalent, dual action principle for both the velocity and hydraulic head.
\end{enumerate}
Mathematically, the derivation of this dual action principle amounts to using the convex conjugate of the action.
So far, we have a (primal) action principle for the ice velocity.
The preceding section suggests that we can likewise derive a dual action principle for both the ice velocity and membrane stress.

The dual form of the shallow stream equations adds the membrane stress tensor $M$ and the basal shear stress $\tau$ explicitly as unknowns in the problem:
\begin{align}
    L(M, \tau, u) = & \int_\Omega\Bigg\{\frac{2}{n + 1}hA\sqrt{\frac{M\cdot M - \frac{1}{d + 1}\text{tr}(M)^2}{2}}^{n + 1} + \frac{1}{m + 1}K|\tau|^{m + 1} \nonumber\\
    & \qquad\qquad + u\cdot\left(\nabla\cdot hM + \tau - \rho_Igh\nabla s\right)\Bigg\}\ud x
\end{align}
The basal shear stress is part of the PDE itself for the shallow stream equations instead of a boundary condition, as they are for the full Stokes equations.
To invert or ``dualize'' this term in the shallow stream approximation, we needed to introduce the basal shear stress explicitly as a distinct variable from the membrane stress.

The key feature of this dual formulation is that \textbf{the nature of the nonlinearity has changed}.
In the primal action shown in equation \eqref{eq:ssa-primal-action}, the nonlinearity consists of the strain rate raised to the power $\frac{1}{n} + 1$.
Since $n > 1$, the nonlinearity in the primal form has an infinite singularity in its second derivative around any velocity field with zero strain rate.
In the dual form, however, the nonlinearity consists of the stress tensor raised to the power $n + 1$.
Around zero stress, the second derivative of the action with respect to the stress is zero instead of infinity; see figure \ref{fig:primal-vs-dual}.

    \caption{The viscous part of the action for the primal problem as a function of the strain rate (left) and for the dual problem as a function of the stress (right).

    \label{fig:primal-vs-dual}
\end{figure}


\section{Discretization}

Roughly any conforming finite element basis is stable for the primal form of the Poisson equation.
The most common choice is to use piecewise-continuous polynomials of a given degree $k$ on triangles, or the tensor product of polynomials on quads.
We will refer to this basis as $CG(k)$.
While mixed formulations have many advantages, the key challenge to overcome is that most choices of basis are unstable -- the resulting linear systems are either singular or their inverses have unbounded norm in the limit as the mesh is refined.
For example, using $CG(k)$ elements for the pressure and the product $CG(k)^2$ for the velocity is an unstable discretization of the dual form of the groundwater problem.
For a degree-1 basis, we can remedy this situation by enriching the velocity space with cubic \emph{bubble} functions $B(3)$.
Using the space $(CG(1) \oplus B(3))^2$ for the velocities and $CG(1)$ for the hydraulic head is stable for mixed Poisson \citep{boffi2013mixed}.
We could also have used the \emph{discontinuous} space $DG(k)$ for the pressures and Raviart-Thomas elements $RT(k)$ for the velocity.
The Raviart-Thomas basis functions have continuous normal components across element boundaries, and are thus a conforming discretization of the Sobolev space $H^{\text{div}}(\Omega)$.

The shallow stream equations are formally similar to the 2D elasticity equations and thus much of the theory for discretizing the mixed elasticity system applies here.
Stable discretization of the mixed elasticity problem is much more complicated than the mixed form of the Poisson equation because we have an additional invariant to enforce: the symmetry of the stress tensor.
There are three viable approaches:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use continuous basis functions for both the velocity and the stress tensor and enrich the stress space with bubble functions \citep{brezzi1993mixed}.
        The basis functions for the stress tensor are taken to be symmetric.
    \item Use discontinuous basis functions for velocity and the Raviart-Thomas or similar basis for the rows of the stress tensor.
        Enforce the symmetry of the stress tensor weakly by addition of another Lagrange multiplier; the stress basis is not symmetric a priori \citep{arnold1984peers}.
    \item Use the Arnold-Winther element, which is conforming for mixed elasticity but which requires many degrees of freedom \citep{arnold2002mixed}.
\end{enumerate}
In the demonstrations that follow, we used both bubble functions and the AW element.
Firedrake includes an implementation of the AW element, which is relatively uncommon among software packages for finite element analysis \citep{aznaran2021transformations}.
\textcolor{red}{Actually test it with AW...}


\section{Demonstrations}

We implemented a solver for the dual form of the SSA using the Firedrake package \citep{FiredrakeUserManual}.
To solve for the velocity, membrane stress tensor, and basal stress vector, we used a continuation approach, starting with flow law and sliding law exponents both set to 1 and proceeding in increments towards their assumed true values.
% TODO: More details on cotinuation somewhere, possibly not here
% TODO: Maybe we don't use continuation at all and just use inexact Jacobians instead
% TODO: Maybe we use Rosenbrock schemes with an approximate Jacobian and don't solve the momentum balance equation exactly and that's even dumber but still fine

Here we will present the verification exercises that we used to evaluate the correctness of our implementation, as well as demonstrations of the new capabilities of the dual form compared to the primal form.

Verification is the process of demonstrating that we have correctly specified the dual form of the shallow stream equations and that we can solve them accurately.
A typical verification experiment would be to first find an analytical solution of the physics problem of interest and then calculate the misfit between the exact and numerical solutions as the mesh is refined.
Finite element theory predicts that, as the mesh spacing $\delta x$ is decreased, the misfits decrease asymptotically as $\delta x^p$ for some exponent $p$ depending on the norm, the polynomial order of the basis, and the problem.
We cannot actually evaluate the limit as $\delta x \to 0$.
The best we can do is use a sequence of refined meshes and compute a log-log fit of the errors against the mesh spacing.
If the slope in log-log space of the misfit-mesh spacing curve is close to the expected power $p$, then we have gained some confidence that we have implemented the physics model correctly.
Note that we cannot prove definitively that the implementation is correct; we can only try to find the most rigorous tests we can that might reveal the presence of an error.
% Except for that student of Andrew Appell who did exactly that...

Comparing numerical results against analytically solvable test cases is vital for catching bugs in the code.
Numerical methods do not always fail discretely, so these bugs can be more subtle than, say, the solver crashing.
For example, a common mistake might be to evaluate the viscosity of ice as some constant times \texttt{epsilon ** (-2 / 3)} where \texttt{epsilon} is the absolute value of the strain rate.
In Fortran and C, integer division gives integer results, so this expression would evaluate to \texttt{epsilon ** 0} which is equal to 1.
(By contrast, in Python, integer division can give a floating point result.)
The simulation would describe a linear viscous fluid flow, whereas glacier flow is a nonlinear shear-thinning fluid flow.
The results would still look like a viscous fluid flow and thus might seem fine in the eyeball norm.
Comparing them to an analytical solution, however, would at least reveal the presence of a problem.

The verification experiments that we present below are all taken from those used to test the implementation of the primal form of the SSA in the icepack package \citep{shapero2021icepack}.
The linear ice shelf and ice stream experiments are analytically solvable.
The gibbous ice shelf and \textcolor{red}{MISMIP+} test cases are not analytically solvable.
Instead, we take it on faith that the solvers in icepack are implemented correctly, and check that the dual form solver we present here reproduces the same results as icepack to within discretization error.


\subsection{Linear ice shelf} \label{sec:linear-ice-shelf}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{demos/linear-ice-shelf/results.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Relative $L^2$-norm errors for approximate solutions to the analytical ice shelf test case.
    Convergence rate obtained through a log-log fit of errors against mesh size.}
    \label{fig:linear-ice-shelf-convergence-rate}
\end{figure}

As a first check that we implemented the dual form of the SSA correctly, we used the exact solution for a floating ice shelf with thickness
\begin{equation}
    h = h_0 - \delta h \cdot x / L_x
\end{equation}
in a domain of length $L_x = 20$km.
With a constant value of the fluidity coefficient, the velocity in the $x$ direction is
\begin{equation}
    u_x = u_0 + L_x A \left(\frac{\rho g h_0}{4}\right)^n\left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{\delta h \cdot x}{h_0\cdot L_x}\right)^{n + 1}\right).
\end{equation}
We used a 2D domain in order to make sure that the numerical solution, like the exact solution, has no variation in the $y$ direction.
We tested meshes with between 16 and 256 cells to a side and we used both degree-1 and degree-2 finite elements for the velocity.
The relative errors in the $L^2$ norm have the expected asymptotic convergence rates of $\mathscr{O}(\delta x^2)$ for linear velocity elements and $\mathscr{O}(\delta x^3)$ for quadratic; see figure \ref{fig:linear-ice-shelf-convergence-rate}.

While finite element theory can predict the asymptotic convergence rates, it does not immediately give estimates of what the constant prefactor should be except in the most trivial of linear problems.
The constants can only be evaluated empirically.
In particular, the theory predicts that quadratic elements converge faster asymptotically than linear elements, but it cannot tell us how many cells per side are necessary for each to achieve the same accuracy.
Figure \ref{fig:linear-ice-shelf-convergence-rate} shows that a numerical solution obtained with only 16 cells per side and quadratic elements is roughly as accurate as a solution with 256 cells per side and linear elements.

\subsection{Linear ice stream} \label{sec:linear-ice-stream}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{demos/linear-ice-stream/results.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{Relative $L^2$-norm errors for approximate solutions to the manufactured ice stream test case.}
    \label{fig:linear-ice-stream-convergence-rate}
\end{figure}

We perform a similar experiment as the linear ice shelf but we add basal friction and make the glacier thickness slightly above floating.
Solving the resulting boundary value problem analytically in the presence of friction is now much more difficult.
Instead, we used the method of manufactured solutions -- we picked the ice velocity, thickness, and surface elevation, and generated a friction coefficient that would make this velocity an exact solution.
To generate this friction coefficient we used the computer algebra system sympy \citep{sympy}.
We used the same meshes and geometry as the ice shelf test case.
Again, the numerical solutions converge with the expected accuracy of $\mathscr{O}(\delta x^2)$ for linear velocity elements and $\mathscr{O}(\delta x^3)$ for quadratic elements.
The coarsest solution with quadratic elements likewise has comparable numerical errors to the finest solution with linear elements.
See figure \ref{fig:linear-ice-stream-convergence-rate}.

\subsection{Gibbous ice shelf} \label{sec:gibbous-ice-shelf}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.85\linewidth]{demos/gibbous-ice-shelf/gibbous.png}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The thickness, velocity, and magnitude of the membrane stress tensor in steady state.}
    \label{fig:gibbous}
\end{figure}

As a second check that the dual form of the momentum balance equation produces the same answers as the primal form, we used the synthetic ``gibbous'' ice shelf test case from \S5.3 of \citet{shapero2021icepack}.
The domain consists of the intersection of two circles of different radii chosen to roughly mimic the overall size of Larsen C.
We prescribe the inflow thickness and velocity and run the coupled mass and momentum balance equations for 400 years, at which point the system is close to steady state.
The results are shown in figure \ref{fig:gibbous} and are identical to those obtained from the primal form of the problem up to discretization error.

\subsection{MISMIP+} \label{sec:mismip}

\begin{figure}[t]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{demos/mismip/mismip.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption{The thickness, velocity, membrane stress magnitude, and basal stress for the steady state of the MISMIP+ test case.}
    \label{fig:mismip}
\end{figure}

Here we perform a spin-up to steady state of the MISMIP+ test case \citep{asay2016experimental}.
We used the Weertman sliding law, i.e. $m = 3$, instead of the modifications that assume a plastic rheology at higher sliding speeds.
With the primal solver in icepack, we were unable to use the Weertman sliding law for the entire duration of the simulation because the ice thicknesses were so small as to crash the momentum balance solver.
The dual form does have its own drawbacks.
For example, in the early rapid adjustment stages, we were limited to taking timesteps on the order of 2.5 years.
Longer timesteps, which are desirable for computational efficiency, could then make the momentum balance solver crash with the options we used.
We could in principle remedy this issue with different solver options or more continuation steps.

In summary, it appears as if solvers for the dual form can still converge even when given values of the input data that would make solvers for the primal form crash.
Achieving this convergence may require more coaxing in the form of shorter timesteps, more regularized Jacobians, or more numerical continuation steps.
We regard this tradeoff as a net positive if primal solvers cannot be made to converge even with substantial encouragement.


\section{Discussion}

\textcolor{red}{Finish this...}

Using the dual formulation of the problem has several advantages.
The stress tensor may be an input to other parts of the physics.
For example, it is part of the source terms for both heat and damage.
The dual formulation includes the stress explicitly as an unknown in the problem.
Solving for it directly offers greater accuracy than computing it after the fact from the velocity field.
Second, the dual formulation reverses the behavior of all the nonlinearities around the zero-disturbance state.
Infinite singularities in the primal formulation, which can only be dealt with by fudging the problem itself, become zero degeneracies in the dual.
These degeneracies are still a challenge.
But the problem, with no modifications, is amenable to solution by continuation methods.
We believe that trust region methods might work as well and this remains to be explored.

The dual formulation does come with several disadvantages.
The number of unknowns in the dual formulation is much greater than in the primal form, thus putting more pressure on computer memory.
The resulting linear systems are indefinite rather than positive-definite.
Finally, the choice of finite element basis is much more delicate.
The dual formulation offers alternative possibilities for incorporating plastic yield as an inequality constraint.
